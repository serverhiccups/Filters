Add the initial code to support having filters, implemented with Java's builtin BufferedImage and uColour classes to make
my implementation simple to begin with.

5/11/19

Add all the boilerplate code for saving and loading images, as well as a BasicFilter class with some utility functions
that other Filters can use.

Add JavaDoc comments so that the function and usage of my code is more obvious.

16/5/19

Add an filter that can can the exposure of the image (by multiplying all the colour channels by a constant value), a
basic gaussian filter (with a broken kernel, I'll fix it later) and a 'filter' to convert colour images to black and
white for ease of processing and edge detection.

Start the implementation of my own java.awt.uColour class called 'uColour' (microColour) which should hopefully be faster
than the builtin in one, as well as showing the use of bitwise operators.

23/5/19

Finished the implementation of uColour and fixed the Gaussian kernel generator. Next up: edge detection.

Implemented a basic sobel filter, but it will only work on the red channel, so I'm going to make the image greyscale before I process them.
